An AI agent that plays Halma(an adversarial game similar to checkers)
Implement alpha beta pruning to determine the best subsequent move
Computation is done on the basis of a complex heuristic function taking into account many factors
Output the best move based on a given time frame and thus applies dynamic depth changes
